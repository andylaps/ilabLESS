										<p>Life is no longer wide open. Adult life is a life of a lot of compromise and that’s necessary, there’s a lot of things that, hey, you should be compromising on. there are some essential things where you don’t want to compromise, you know, so figuring those things out. What’s the part of life where you need to compromise to, whatever it be – pay your bills, to get along, you know, to feed your kids, to make your way through the world and then what’s the part of yourself that you can’t compromise with or you lose yourself.

										<h4 class="media-heading">Neal Stephenson</h4>
										<p>He had had many conversations during his long life. Some were fascinating and stayed with him more than a century later. Others were less so. As a younger man he had tolerated those as part of the cost of doing business—a sort of tax that all people must pay in order to take part in civilized society. When he had turned one hundred, he had decided to stop paying that tax. Henceforth he would engage only in conversations that really interested him—which, with a few exceptions for close friends and family members, meant conversations with a purpose. 
										from “Seveneves” by Neal Stephenson</p>

										<p>It is hardly surprising that children should enthusiastically start their education at an early age with the Absolute Knowledge of computer science; while they are unable to read, for reading demands making judgments at every line. Conversation is almost dead, and soon so too will be those who knew how to speak.</p>

										<p>The TV scientist who mutters sadly, “The experiment is a failure; we have failed to achieve what we had hoped for,” is suffering mainly from a bad script writer. An experiment is never a failure solely because it fails to achieve predicted results. An experiment is a failure only when it also fails adequately to test the hypothesis in question, when the data it produces don't prove anything one way or another.

										<p>Traditionally, design teachers have been practising designers who pass on their knowledge, skills and values through a process of apprenticeship. Design students ‘act out’ the role of designer in small projects6, and are tutored in the process by more experienced designers. These design teachers are firstly designers, and only secondly and incidentally teachers. This model may be defensible for specialist education7, but in general education all teachers are (or should be) firstly teachers, and only secondly, if at all, specialists in any field.

										<h4 class="media-heading">Charles Bukowski</h4>
										<p>Drinking is an emotional thing. It joggles you out of everyday life, out of everything being the same. It yanks you out of your body and your mind and throws you against the wall. I have the feeling that drinking is a form of suicide where you’re allowed to return to life and begin all over the next day. It’s like killing yourself, and then you’re reborn. I guess I’ve lived about ten or fifteen thousand lives now.
