								<h4>The home of Arduino</h4></a>
								<p>“Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. It's intended for anyone making interactive projects. Arduino senses the environment by receiving inputs from many sensors, and affects its surroundings by controlling lights, motors, and other actuators. You can tell your Arduino what to do by writing code in the Arduino programming language and using the Arduino development environment.” </p>

								<h4>Shenzen maker movement <div class="badge">video</div></h4></a>
								<p>Second episode of the WIRED documentary series. The video takes "a look at how the Maker movement has been appropriated in a frenetic manufacturing hub like Shenzhen, before exploring how the city’s attitudes to open source hardware are so different to those of the West, and what this might mean for both sides of the argument in the near future. Future Cities is part of a new flagship documentary strand from WIRED Video that explores the technologies, trends and ideas that are changing our world." Video. WIRED magazine. 2016.</p>

								<h4>Simone Giertz</h4></a>
								<p>YouTube channel from the Queen of Intentionally Shitty Robots. 'A shitty robot, says Stockholm-based Giertz, "is one that solves a problem that doesn't exist, or solves a problem that does exist, but in a bad way".  ... People think it's about the robot uprising, or a commentary on people being so lazy that they can't even make themselves breakfast," Giertz muses. "Electronics are getting more and more accessible now - you don't have to be an engineer to start building things. I really want to spur [on] that democratisation of technology."'

								<h4>Robert Pirsig</h4></a>
								<p>The TV scientist who mutters sadly, “The experiment is a failure; we have failed to achieve what we had hoped for,” is suffering mainly from a bad script writer. An experiment is never a failure solely because it fails to achieve predicted results. An experiment is a failure only when it also fails adequately to test the hypothesis in question, when the data it produces don't prove anything one way or another. Robert M. Pirsig, Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance: An Inquiry Into Values</p>

								<h4>Nigel Cross</h4></a>
								<p>Traditionally, design teachers have been practising designers who pass on their knowledge, skills and values through a process of apprenticeship. Design students ‘act out’ the role of designer in small projects6, and are tutored in the process by more experienced designers. These design teachers are firstly designers, and only secondly and incidentally teachers. This model may be defensible for specialist education7, but in general education all teachers are (or should be) firstly teachers, and only secondly, if at all, specialists in any field. Nigel Cross 1982</p>
