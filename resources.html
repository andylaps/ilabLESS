								<h4>The home of Arduino</h4></a>
								<p>“Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. It's intended for anyone making interactive projects. Arduino senses the environment by receiving inputs from many sensors, and affects its surroundings by controlling lights, motors, and other actuators. You can tell your Arduino what to do by writing code in the Arduino programming language and using the Arduino development environment.” </p>

								<h4>Neal Stephenson <div class="badge">great</div></h4></a>
								<p>He had had many conversations during his long life. Some were fascinating and stayed with him more than a century later. Others were less so. As a younger man he had tolerated those as part of the cost of doing business—a sort of tax that all people must pay in order to take part in civilized society. When he had turned one hundred, he had decided to stop paying that tax. Henceforth he would engage only in conversations that really interested him—which, with a few exceptions for close friends and family members, meant conversations with a purpose. 
								from “Seveneves” by Neal Stephenson</p>

								<h4>Guy Debord</h4><div class="badge">slow</div></a>
								<p>It is hardly surprising that children should enthusiastically start their education at an early age with the Absolute Knowledge of computer science; while they are unable to read, for reading demands making judgments at every line. Conversation is almost dead, and soon so too will be those who knew how to speak.</p>

											The beauty parlor is filled with sailors The circus is in town Here comes the blind commissioner They've got him in a trance One hand is tied to the tight-rope walker The other is in his pantsAnd the riot squad they're restless They need somewhere to go As Lady and I look out tonight From Desolation Row.</p>

								<h4>Robert Pirsig</h4></a>
								<p>The TV scientist who mutters sadly, “The experiment is a failure; we have failed to achieve what we had hoped for,” is suffering mainly from a bad script writer. An experiment is never a failure solely because it fails to achieve predicted results. An experiment is a failure only when it also fails adequately to test the hypothesis in question, when the data it produces don't prove anything one way or another. Robert M. Pirsig, Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance: An Inquiry Into Values</p>

								<h4>Nigel Cross</h4></a>
								<p>Traditionally, design teachers have been practising designers who pass on their knowledge, skills and values through a process of apprenticeship. Design students ‘act out’ the role of designer in small projects6, and are tutored in the process by more experienced designers. These design teachers are firstly designers, and only secondly and incidentally teachers. This model may be defensible for specialist education7, but in general education all teachers are (or should be) firstly teachers, and only secondly, if at all, specialists in any field. Nigel Cross 1982</p>
